 # Chat-App

This project combines Django and React to create a real-time chat application. In the Django and DRF section, a Chat Model is established in Models.py, integrated into the admin panel, and tested through migrations. A Chat Serializer is created in Serializer.py for efficient data handling. Complex queries in Views.py enable listing all messages, retrieving conversations between two users, sending messages, and obtaining profile details using Django's powerful ORM. In the React Frontend section, a Message.js component is crafted for displaying chat messages with a corresponding route in App.js. The component fetches messages from the database through the API endpoint, iterates over them, and dynamically updates the template. A MessageDetail.js component is introduced for detailed message views, featuring the ability to send messages in real-time. Overall, this project seamlessly integrates Django's robust backend capabilities with React's dynamic frontend, resulting in a sophisticated chat application with features for messaging, retrieval, and user profiling.
